Lndroid.Messenger - instant messages over Lightning Network for Android
=======================================================================

Lndroid.Messenger is an instant messaging app that sends messages over Lightning Network. The app can connect to any Lightning wallet based on [Lndroid.Framework](https://github.com/lndroid/lndroid-framework/) using [Lndroid.Client](https://github.com/lndroid/lndroid-client/) library. It is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, and with great luck to become a real messaging app.

The custom records used to attach messages to lightning payments are the same as in [Whatsat](https://github.com/joostjager/whatsat), except for the message signature, which is not yet implemented. When full compatibility is implemented, you'd be able to exchange messages with Whatsat apps.

To see the video demonstration of the app, check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF-1QxFTvHU). Description of what is happening on the video is [available here](https://github.com/lndroid/lndroid-wallet/#here-is-what-you-see-on-the-lndroid-demo-video).

# Important

The whole Lndroid project is at the very early stages of development. No guarantees are made about API stability, or the like. Do not use Lndroid code on Bitcoin mainnet, as you're very likely to lose your funds.
